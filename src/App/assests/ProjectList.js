    </a>
    , I have created five apps using Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, and React
    Native. Four of those apps were done with a partner, with the final app
    being a solo project. I've also created a web automation bot in Python that
    my brother uses to create tee times for the weekends. Demo video and Github
    links are on the bottom of each description.

    The first project I have ever created was a CLI app written in Ruby. This
    app allows you to search Giphy through the Giphy API and save gifs in the
    categories of your choosing. Categories and gifs are saved to your account,
    so you can always go back and view them again.

    My second project was my first website written in Ruby, using the Ruby on
    Rails framework. It was another partner project created with Tim Butler. We
    decided to remake Yelp. Allowing users to search, rate, and comment on
    restaurants using the Yelp API.

    For my third project, we created a SPA in vanilla JS. My partner{" "}

    and I made a Pokemon RPG using the PokeAPI. Users were able to create an
    account, collect items, catch Pokemon, and display themselves on the
    hiscores. For this project, we saved our frontend and backend to seperate
    Githubs. Both links are below.

    . We made a translation app in React. Using Google translate, and the MDN
    Web Speech API. You could take lessons in five different languages, go on an
    endless run trying to beat your PB, or translate and save messages using
    voice or text. Again, we saved the frontend and backend to different
    Githubs.

    The solo project! My final project while I was at Flatiron was a React
    Native app called $ellular. I decided to remake the idea of 'LetGo'.
    Allowing users to create accounts, post items they want to sell, browse
    other users items, real-time chat with them, and give them a rating after
    they've purchased their item. I have saved my frontend and backend to
    seperate repos.
